# Justification

The assignment says I have to create a single page application so I used states toggle between screens.

I used
zustand - for state management<br>
react-native-paper - for design elements<br>
formik - for form validations.
and axios - for rest api calls.

zustand is simple and lightweight state management tool. I think for this usecase, this library suites well. Hence zustand.<br>
react-native-paper provides material design like elements for react native. To make the product look good in limited time, this looked better option that creating my own styling.<br>
formik is lightweight form validation library.<br>
axios is easy to use rest api library.<br>
